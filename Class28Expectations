Thanks for giving me the oppontinuty to partake in this DevOps programe,
and my expection is to get job offers by end of this programe,
as in, i mean exactly during or after boot camp.
I started preping for testimony even before class started and trusting GOD,
for open doors and favor, as i start and end the full DevOps programe..In Jesus name.
